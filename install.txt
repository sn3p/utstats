1. UTStats Actor Install Information
===============================================================================

From the System folder in the zip file, copy to your UTServer\System folder the
following files:

UTSAccuBeta4_2.u
UTStatsBeta4_2.u

Remove any previous entries for UTStats and UTSAccuBeta from [Engine.GameEngine]

Add to [Engine.GameEngine] the following lines:

ServerPackages=UTSAccuBeta4_2
ServerActors=UTStatsBeta4_2.UTStatsSA

Under the [Engine.GameInfo] check for:
bLocalLog=True or bLocalLog=False

This line HAS to be:
bLocalLog=False

Setting it to True will not give you complete logs (don't ask why it just won't).

Log files are recorded to the UTServer\Logs folder.

2. UTStats Web Install Information
===============================================================================

UPGRADING from Version 4.2 and newer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current install is compatible with the database of version 4.2 and later.
However bunny track stats are only available from version 4.2.5.

Just remove all the files/folders (apart from the logs folder, if you wish to
keep your backup logs), and upload all the files in the html folder to your
webserver.

Then visit the admin area and click "Check Server Settings" near the bottom of
the list. This will install databases if they're missing and fix the Bunny
Track captimes to the new format if needed.

If you use your old config.php make sure the following section is included:

// ================ START OF ADDITINAL CONFIG.PHP OPTIONS =====================
// Screenshot files start with...
$import_utdc_screenshot_start = "[UTDC]";

// Screenshot files end with...
$import_utdc_screenshot_extension = ".enc";

// UTStats can download and manage your ACE logs
// Enable downloading of ACE logs?
$import_ace_download_enable = false;

// Log files start with...
$import_ace_log_start = "[ACE]";

// Log files end with...
$import_ace_log_extension = ".log";

// Log files start with...
$import_ace_screenshot_start = "[ACE]";

// Log files end with...
$import_ace_screenshot_extension = ".jpg";

// Compress ACE logfiles after download? [compress/gzip/no]
// (see $import_log_backup for available options)
$import_ace_log_compress = "compress";

// Purge old ACE logs after x days. 0 to disable.
$import_ace_log_purge_after = 0;
// ================= END OF ADDITINAL CONFIG.PHP OPTIONS ======================

UPGRADING from older versions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly we don't advise using any old logs, you will not benefit from any new 
features AND it will likely mess up some page data.
We apologise for not being able to save this information but there are a 
massive amount of new features that are well worth ditching the old logs for :)

If you do wish to keep the old logs you need to do a full install anyway, so 
drop all the tables you had and remove all the 
files/folders (making sure you don't delete the logs backups).
When you edit config.php make sure to change the option:
$import_incompatible_logs=false;
to 
$import_incompatible_logs=true;

If you are wisely going to ditch the old logs just clear out your old install 
and all the tables and start from here.

FULL INSTALL:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the html folder in the zip file, upload all the files to your webserver 
wherever you like.  I suggest under a folder called utstats.
After the files have uploaded browse to the stats folder where you should see 
the following folders:

\images
\import
\includes
\logs
\pages

Now edit the config.php file.

Enter in your mysql database, hostname, username and password at the top.
You must set an adminkey in here or you won't be able to import/use the admin 
feature.
Check all the other options to see if they are as you wish (they are set to 
what we consider the best options).
If you are going to use ftp transferring of log files amend the FTP connection 
as required.

Now visit the admin area and click "Check Server Settings" near the bottom.
This will setup the database, if the tables allready exist it will keep the
old tables. It will also check the file permissions. If it can't set
the file permissions you'll have to do it yourself,

Using whatever means (usually the ftp client) you need to CHMOD the logs folder 
to 777.
Now go into the logs folder.
Now CHMOD the backups, utdc, ac and ace folders to 777.

Now go back a level and into the includes folder.
CHMOD the file ftptimestamp.php to 777.

=================
3. Importing Logs
=================

Depending on the level of access you have and how competent you are you can do this 4 ways.
*** Important *** 
Make sure you edit config.php and set an adminkey at the top!

Way 1:
If you don't have ftp access to your UT server or allowed to use ftp via php then upload your 
logs manually to the logs folder and then run the importer via the Import link.

Way 2:
If you have ftp access and can do ftp via php, edit the config.php file and input your UT servers ftp
information into there.
Now run the importer via the Import link.

Way 3:
Automate the process using a cron job or scheduled task.
Just get this to run cd to the root of stats (where import.php is) and execute the import.php file
with php.

Way 4:
Automate the web process using a web service cron job.
